Issue Summarization of tha Postmortem :Tha web stack debugging project encountered a 2-hour outage (from 08:00 AM to 10:00 AM UTC) that temporarily affected user authentication service. Approximately 20% of users experienced login issues during this period. The root cause was traced back to database connection pool exhaustion caused by a sudden surge in concurrent user requests. Automated monitoring detected the issue
corrections Taken and Corrective Measures:
 Initially, tha team investigated authentication service logs, assuming increased user traffic as the cause. However, misleading paths diverted their attention to potential DDoS attacks and hardware failures.
 Escalation to the Database Operations team and Microservices Architecture lead occurred as the issue persisted. To resolve it, they rolled back the recent authentication service update, adjusted database connection parameters, and applied an emergency patch. Stricter code review policies were introduced to catch configuration issues early in the development phase. Additionally, they planned improvements such as enhanced monitoring, streamlined rollback processes, and additional automated tests in the CI/CD pipeline.
